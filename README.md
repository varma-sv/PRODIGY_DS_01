**Overview** : 
This repository contains the code and visualizations created for Task 01 of my internship at Prodigy. The objective was to analyze and visualize global population data from the World Bank.


**Data** : 
The dataset used for this analysis is the World Bank Population Dataset, which contains population data for various countries from 1960 to 2021.

**Visualizations** : 
1. **Total Population Over the Years** :
This bar chart shows the total global population from 1960 to 2021.
2. **Top 50 Most Populous Countries in 1960** :
This bar chart highlights the top 50 most populous countries in 1960.
3. **Population of the United States Over the Years** :
This bar chart visualizes the population growth of the United States from 1960 to 2021.

**Technologies Used**
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn

**Learnings**
**Data Analysis** 
1. Data Extraction: Learned how to extract relevant data from a large dataset and handle missing values.
2. Data Cleaning: Improved skills in data preprocessing, including cleaning and organizing data for analysis.
3. Data Aggregation: Gained experience in aggregating data across different time periods to reveal trends and insights.

**Data Visualization**
1. Visualization Techniques: Enhanced ability to create clear and informative bar charts and histograms.
2. Library Proficiency: Became more proficient with Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating various types of visualizations.
3. Customization: Learned how to customize plots with titles, labels, colors, and sizes to make them more engaging and understandable.

**Insights and Analysis**
1. Historical Trends: Gained insights into global population trends over the past six decades.
2. Country-Specific Analysis: Developed skills in analyzing population trends for specific countries and comparing them with global data.
3. Top Populous Countries: Identified and visualized the most populous countries in a specific year, providing historical context.

**Conclusion** : 
Completing this task provided me with valuable experience in data analysis and visualization. By working with real-world population data, I developed a deeper understanding of:
1. Global Population Trends: Observing how the world's population has grown and shifted over the years.
2. Analytical Techniques: Applying various data analysis techniques to derive meaningful insights from complex datasets.
3. Visualization Skills: Creating effective visual representations of data that communicate insights clearly and effectively.
